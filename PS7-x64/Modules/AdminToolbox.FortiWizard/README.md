# FortiWizard
This module was born from a desire to use variables for generating Fortinet config scripts. It has since developed as a way to take the output of a config function and push it to a FortiGate through invoked SSH commands.

Disclaimer: This module is in no way associated with Fortinet. Use of this module is at your own risk and no guarantees are made.
